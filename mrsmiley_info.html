            <li>Additional Comments</li>
            <ul>
                <li>At most, I added hearts over the couple's head just so that we can really see the love. They scale and move with the couple.</li>
                <li>I didn't really have too much errors when it can to the program, just at first, rotating was very buggy at first</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Minor Improvements</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I don't feel like any of these are worth extra credit but it makes this page interesting</li>
                <li>Instead of making multiple instances of the fence class, it displays the fence all at once.</li>
                <li>Only one interval is called, it made to not go to choppy or incredibly smooth</li>
            </ul>
